The next password is stored in the file data.txt next to the word "millionth". So inside the file data.txt is the password next to the word "millionth"

Instead of searching for a file, we need to search IN a file. For this we can use "grep". It is used to search for text patterns within files or inputs.

cat data.txt | grep "millionth"

output looks like this:
millionth       "PASSWORD"
