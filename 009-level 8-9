In this level, the password is a unique line of text within the data.txt file

To search for the unique line of text we need to remember something specific about the "cat" and "uniq" commands.

Cat outputs the file directly as it's written, and the uniq command requires adjacent duplicate lines to function properly. 
Uniq only removes, or reports, duplicate lines that are adjacent and does not search the entire file for duplicates - it processes the lines as they come.
If the file isn't sorted, uniq won't recognize them as duplicates. We need to sort to ensure that duplicate lines are adjecent. 

sort data.txt

This output shows a list of lines of text that is sorted alphabetically and numerically - starting with 0-9 and continuing with a-z.
This output can further be used with pipe and the uniq command. Remember to use "-u" after uniq to ensure only those lines that occur once will be outputted

sort data.txt | uniq -u
