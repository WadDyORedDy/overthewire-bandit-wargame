The next passsword is stored in a file in the "inhere" directory. The file has all of the following properties
- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

To search for a file with specific properties we can use the find-command.

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable

From the output we know that the file is ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2 (remember the dot at the beginning of the password-file)

cat /inhere/maybehere07/.file2
