ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

The next password-file could be located anywhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

We can use the same find command from earlier with a few corrections:

find . type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6

This outputs a lot of "permission denied" files, and from a quick run-through one of the files is not denied: "./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password",
however we can make the output alot clearer by outputting it to "2>/dev/null" to remove all errors from the output. 

find . type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null which returns the correct file.
Fun fact: 1/dev/null removes all normal output and leaves error-outputs in the output.
