The next password is stored in data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

The keyword in this assignment is "strings" which also is the command we need to use. By using "strings" we extract printable strings from a binary file.

strings data.txt

This outputs alot of gibberish, but we can grep it with the other part of the assignment "several '=' characters"

strings data.txt | grep "=="

The output is:
